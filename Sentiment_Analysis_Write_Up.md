# Starbucks Sentiment Analysis Write Up
## Approach
While browsing the .csv file for the Starbucks reviews, the file had sections with ratings from 1-5.  I used those ratings to create a comparitive bar chart to see if there were discrepencies in the ratings.  Secondly, I created tables of other data in relation to their continuing patronage.
